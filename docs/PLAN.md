# Zord — Local Audio Capture & Transcription

> A fast, self-contained, **fully-local** desktop application that records your
> microphone **and** background/desktop audio (Teams, Zoom, browser, anything),
> then produces an accurate, timestamped, searchable transcript labeled by
> source ("Me" vs "Others"). No cloud, no server. All capture, processing, and
> transcription happen on-device.

## 1. Decisions locked in

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Platforms** | macOS (Apple Silicon) **+** Windows | Teams runs on both. macOS shipped first, Windows second. |
| **Distribution** | Native desktop app (Dioxus Desktop) + optional **localhost** web dashboard | A browser sandbox *cannot* capture system audio. Native is the only way to meet the core requirement. Local web UI is a review surface only. |
| **UI framework** | **Dioxus 0.7.x** (Rust) | Current stable (0.7.9, May 2026). Cross-platform desktop via WebView, RSX, hot-reload. |
| **Language** | Rust (entire stack) | Per requirement. One workspace, multiple crates. |
| **Source separation** | Two independent channels: **mic** + **system loopback**, transcribed separately, labeled "Me" / "Others" | Far more reliable than ML speaker diarization. No diarization model needed. |
| **Transcription** | `whisper-rs` 0.16 (whisper.cpp) | Mature, actively maintained, GPU-accelerated (Metal/CUDA/Vulkan). Runs fully local. |
| **Model** | `large-v3-turbo` (quantized) default; configurable | ~95%+ of large-v3 accuracy at 2–5× the speed. English-only build can also use `distil-large-v3` / `*.en` models. |
| **Hardware** | Auto-detect acceleration; model size is a setting | User hardware "varies" — detect Metal/CUDA at runtime, fall back to CPU, recommend a model accordingly. |
| **Mode** | **Batch / near-real-time** (not strictly live) | Accuracy > latency. Transcribe in chunks behind a queue. |
| **Trigger** | **Manual start/stop** for v1 | Predictable and private. Auto-detect meetings is a later phase. |
| **Language scope** | **English** | Use English-tuned models for best speed/accuracy. |
| **Audio retention** | **Setting** — keep audio + transcript by default; toggle + auto-delete-after-N-days | Lets you re-transcribe later with better models; respects disk/privacy. |
| **Post-processing** | Timestamps + full-text search + export (Markdown / SRT / JSON) | AI summaries and custom vocabulary are explicitly **out of v1 scope** (future phase). |

A single `AudioSource` trait abstracts capture so the rest of the app is
OS-agnostic:

```rust
pub enum Source { Microphone, System }

pub trait AudioSource: Send {
    /// Native sample format/rate of this source.
    fn config(&self) -> AudioConfig;
    /// Start delivering f32 PCM frames to `sink` until stopped.
    fn start(&mut self, sink: FrameSink) -> Result<()>;
    fn stop(&mut self);
}
```

---

## 3. The hard parts (gaps) and how we close them

These are the things that sink projects like this. Each is addressed by a
specific phase and mitigation.

### G1 — System ("desktop") audio capture is OS-specific and permissioned
- **macOS:** Use the `screencapturekit` crate (v1.5.0). Captures system audio
  (and mic) via Apple's ScreenCaptureKit on macOS 13+. **Requires the user to
  grant Screen Recording permission** (TCC prompt) the first time, plus
  Microphone permission. App must handle the "permission not yet granted" state
  gracefully and link to System Settings.
- **Windows:** Use the `wasapi` crate for **loopback** capture of the default
  render device, and `cpal`/`wasapi` for the mic. *We deliberately avoid relying
  on `cpal`'s built-in loopback* — it has a history of being removed/flaky
  (RustAudio/cpal issues #251, #476, #516). The `wasapi` crate exposes
  `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_LOOPBACK` directly and reliably.
- **Mitigation:** Phase 0 is a *capture spike* on each OS before any UI work —
  prove we can write 30s of clean mic + system WAV on both platforms.

### G2 — Two devices = two clocks (drift & alignment)
Mic and system streams run on independent clocks at possibly different sample
rates. Over a long call they drift.
- **Mitigation:** Stamp every captured buffer with a monotonic wall-clock time
  at arrival. Resample both to 16 kHz mono (`rubato`). Align transcript segments
  by their wall-clock timestamps, not by sample count. Interleave the two
  channels' segments into one timeline for the UI.

### G3 — Whisper input requirements
whisper.cpp expects **16 kHz, mono, f32**. Capture is often 44.1/48 kHz stereo.
- **Mitigation:** A fixed resample stage (`rubato`, high-quality sinc) +
  downmix in `zord-audio`. Validate with a known sample.

### G4 — Long recordings: memory & latency
A 1-hour call is huge if buffered in RAM, and you don't want to wait until the
end to transcribe.
- **Mitigation:** Stream PCM to a ring buffer; **VAD-segment** on silence into
  utterance chunks (target 5–30 s). Push chunks to a bounded transcription queue
  consumed by a worker pool. Optionally append raw audio to a WAV on disk as we
  go (if retention is on). This gives near-real-time results without blocking.

### G5 — GPU detection & model selection
Hardware "varies."
- **Mitigation:** At startup detect Metal (macOS) / CUDA (Windows+NVIDIA);
  fall back to CPU. Recommend a default model per detected capability
  (e.g. large-v3-turbo on GPU, small/distil on CPU). Expose model choice in
  Settings. First-run **downloads** the chosen ggml model from Hugging Face to a
  local cache (this is a *model* download, not a server dependency — fully
  offline thereafter).

### G6 — Distribution & signing (the boring blocker)
Unsigned native apps that ask for mic + screen-recording permission are a
terrible UX (Gatekeeper / SmartScreen warnings).
- **macOS:** Bundle via `dx bundle` / `cargo-bundle`; declare
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and screen-recording entitlements in
  `Info.plist`; **codesign + notarize** for distribution outside the App Store.
- **Windows:** Build an installer (e.g. MSI via `cargo-wix` or NSIS);
  **Authenticode sign** to avoid SmartScreen.
- **Mitigation:** Phase 6 owns this; document the signing steps and provide a
  GitHub Actions release workflow that builds, signs, and attaches artifacts.

### G7 — Bundling the native whisper library
`whisper-rs` compiles whisper.cpp (and GPU kernels) via its build script.
- **Mitigation:** Pin `whisper-rs`; build with `metal` feature on macOS and
  `cuda` feature (optional, behind a build flag) on Windows. Provide a CPU-only
  fallback binary so users without CUDA still get a working release.

### G8 — Privacy & data at rest
Everything is local, but transcripts/audio are sensitive.
- **Mitigation:** Store under the OS app-data dir. Offer optional
  encryption-at-rest (SQLCipher) and a clear retention policy (auto-delete audio
  after N days; transcripts kept). A visible "all-local, nothing leaves this
  machine" statement + a one-click "delete this session."

### G9 — Permission UX & failure states
Capture can fail: permission denied, device unplugged, no loopback device.
- **Mitigation:** Explicit app states (`NeedsPermission`, `NoSystemDevice`,
  `Recording`, `Transcribing`, `Idle`) surfaced in the UI with actionable copy.

## 4. Core data model (`zord-store`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- uuid
  started_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- unix ms
  ended_at    INTEGER,
  title       TEXT,
  audio_path  TEXT,                    -- nullable if discarded
  model       TEXT NOT NULL            -- which whisper model produced it
);

CREATE TABLE segments (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id  TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id),
  source      TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'me' | 'others'
  t_start_ms  INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- relative to session start
  t_end_ms    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  text        TEXT NOT NULL,
  words_json  TEXT                     -- optional word-level timestamps
);

-- Full-text search over segment text
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE segments_fts USING fts5(
  text, content='segments', content_rowid='id'
);
```

Export renders from these tables: **Markdown** (readable transcript), **SRT**
(subtitles, from timestamps), **JSON** (full fidelity incl. word timings).

## 5. Recommended crate stack

| Concern | Crate(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UI | `dioxus` 0.7.x (`desktop` feature) | WebView-based desktop. |
| Local web dashboard | `axum`, `tower-http` | Bind `127.0.0.1` only. |
| Mic capture | `cpal` | Cross-platform input. |
| System capture (macOS) | `screencapturekit` 1.5 | System + mic, macOS 13+. |
| System capture (Windows) | `wasapi` | Reliable loopback flag. |
| Resampling | `rubato` | High-quality sinc → 16 kHz mono. |
| VAD | `voice_activity_detector` (silero) or `webrtc-vad` | Silence-based segmentation. |
| Transcription | `whisper-rs` 0.16 + ggml model | Features: `metal` / `cuda`. |
| Storage | `rusqlite` (bundled, FTS5) or `sqlx` + SQLite; optional `sqlcipher` | Local DB + search. |
| WAV I/O | `hound` | Write/read raw audio. |
| Async runtime | `tokio` | Queues, web server, workers. |
| Errors/logging | `thiserror`, `tracing` | |
| Packaging | `dx bundle` / `cargo-bundle`, `cargo-wix` | macOS .app / Windows MSI. |

> Validate exact versions with `cargo add` at implementation time; the build
> script for `whisper-rs` needs a C/C++ toolchain + CMake on the build machine.

## 6. Phased delivery

Each phase ends with a **demoable, testable** result. macOS is the lead
platform; Windows-specific capture lands in Phase 2b.

### Phase 0 — De-risking spikes (1–2 days)  ⚠️ do this first
- [ ] Workspace skeleton + CI (build on macOS & Windows).
- [ ] **macOS capture spike:** record 30 s of mic + system audio to two WAVs via
      `screencapturekit`; confirm permission prompts work.
- [ ] **Windows capture spike:** same, via `wasapi` loopback + mic.
- [ ] **whisper spike:** transcribe a known WAV with `whisper-rs`, GPU + CPU.
- **Exit criteria:** clean WAVs on both OSes + a correct transcript of a test clip.
  *If a capture path is blocked, we learn it now, not in month two.*

### Phase 1 — Single-channel end-to-end (mic only)  ✅ DONE
- [x] `zord-audio`: resample to 16 kHz mono (rubato) + energy/VAD segmentation.
- [x] `zord-transcribe`: whisper-rs (Metal), first-run model download/cache.
- [x] `zord-store`: SQLite schema + insert + FTS5 search.
- [x] CLI trigger (`zord record` live mic; `zord file` for deterministic test).
- **Exit criteria MET:** verified against canonical `jfk.wav` — accurate
  transcript, correct timestamps, stored in SQLite, Metal GPU confirmed, FTS5
  search returns correct segments. Live mic path (`zord record`) uses the
  identical pipeline; needs an interactive run (macOS mic-permission prompt).

### Phase 2 — Dual-channel capture + sync  🟡 macOS impl done; live-verify pending
- **2a (macOS):** ✅ `zord-capture` crate — `Microphone` (cpal) + `SystemAudio`
  (ScreenCaptureKit 6.1). Both emit mono f32; system audio via `SCStream` with
  `captures_audio`. Graceful degradation if Screen Recording permission absent.
- [x] Dual-channel pipeline: per-channel resample+VAD, fan-in to one transcribe
  stage, per-channel first-frame base offset → single interleaved timeline.
- [x] Builds + runs; mic-only fallback path verified (clean degradation message).
- [ ] **Live verification (user step):** grant Screen Recording permission, play
  audio while speaking, confirm Me/Others attribution. (Requires TCC grant +
  real audio — can't be automated.)
- **2b (Windows):** `wasapi` loopback + `cpal` mic — not started (no Windows
  host here; trait is structured so it slots in).
- **Build note:** macOS 13 deployment target + a Swift-lib search path are set in
  `.cargo/config.toml` for the ScreenCaptureKit Swift bridge (CLT-only setups).

### Phase 3 — Dioxus desktop UI  ✅ DONE (built + launches)
- [x] `zord-gui` crate (Dioxus 0.7 desktop). Threaded `Engine`: a control thread
  owns the `!Send` capture streams; a db thread answers queries; both push
  events to the UI over a tokio channel, drained into signals by a `spawn`ed task.
- [x] Record/Stop control, status indicator (idle/preparing/downloading/recording),
  live Me/Others level meters.
- [x] Session sidebar + transcript view (Me/Others colour + timestamps); click a
  session to load it.
- [x] **FTS5 search** box across all sessions (sanitized MATCH query).
- [x] Permission/error states (G9): degradation notice banner, error status.
- **Exit criteria MET (build/launch):** compiles, launches a window, event loop
  runs, no panic. Live recording behaviour shares Phase 1/2 verified pipeline;
  full click-through with real audio is the same interactive step as Phase 2.
- CLI (`zord`) retained alongside the GUI.

### Phase 4 — Export + local web dashboard  ✅ DONE (verified)
- [x] `zord-export` crate: Markdown / SRT / JSON renderers (pure functions).
- [x] CLI `zord export <id> --format md|srt|json [--out]`.
- [x] `zord-web` crate: axum dashboard bound to `127.0.0.1`; routes `/`,
      `/api/sessions`, `/api/session/:id`, `/api/search?q=`; DB reads via
      `spawn_blocking`. CLI `zord serve [--port]`.
- [x] GUI export buttons (MD/SRT/JSON) when viewing a session → writes to the
      app data `exports/` dir, shows a notice.
- **Exit criteria MET:** exported jfk session to all three formats (valid SRT
  timestamps, clean MD, full JSON); launched `zord serve` and curled every
  endpoint successfully; GUI builds with export bar.

### Phase 5 — Settings, retention & polish
- [ ] Settings: model choice, audio retention toggle + auto-delete-after-N-days,
      device selection, storage location.
- [ ] Optional encryption-at-rest (SQLCipher).
- [ ] Re-transcribe a kept session with a different model.
- **Exit criteria:** Configurable, privacy-respecting, robust to bad inputs.

### Phase 6 — Packaging & distribution
- [ ] macOS: `.app` bundle, entitlements, codesign + notarize.
- [ ] Windows: MSI installer, Authenticode signing.
- [ ] GitHub Actions release workflow (build → sign → attach to Release).
- [ ] CPU-only fallback build alongside GPU builds.
- **Exit criteria:** Download a signed binary from GitHub Releases and run it
  with no warnings.

### Phase 7 — Future (explicitly out of v1 scope)
- Auto-detect active meeting apps (Teams/Zoom) → prompt/auto-start.
- Local AI summaries / action items via a local LLM (llama.cpp).
- Custom vocabulary (whisper `initial_prompt` / hotword biasing).
- Per-speaker diarization within the "Others" channel.
- Multilingual support.

## 7. Open questions to revisit during build
1. ~~**macOS minimum version**~~ — **DECIDED:** target whatever runs on Apple
   Silicon M1–M5. We'll set the deployment target to macOS 13 (the first version
   with ScreenCaptureKit system-audio support that all M-series machines run),
   and use 14/15 APIs only behind availability checks if ever needed.
2. **Windows mic + loopback device pairing** — handle multiple output devices
   (which one is "the call"?). Default render device for v1.
3. ~~**Model download UX**~~ — **DECIDED:** always **download on first run**
   (with progress UI); never embed the model in the application binary/installer.
   Cached locally thereafter → fully offline.
4. **CUDA in releases** — ship CUDA builds, or CPU-only + "build from source for
   GPU"? CUDA build matrix adds CI complexity.
